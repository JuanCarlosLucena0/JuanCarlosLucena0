# Halaman Tower

This is just a small game i did for my final proyect, a rogue-like turn base game link to an API REST on PythonAnywhere. Only Mouse needed.

This version needs of an account (it will not send any kind of verification so just **put any random email and password**, dont worry). 

If it doesnt work, or the password its wrong or the server its dead (yes, i should had add more feedback, but notice it later and rigth now im working on more things that will come handier for my future).

If anyone plays it, thanks in advance for giving it a try.
